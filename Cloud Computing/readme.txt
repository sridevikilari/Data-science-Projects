Project name: Victoria Road Crash Statstics
Short description: VicRoads provides crash statistics data to organizations, researchers, and the general public to help with education, research and the development of road safety programs and initiatives. The main objective of this project is to provide statistics and insights related to Victoria state crashes to the public which is to educate and prevent any possible accidents in the future. 

Given the population of state is over 6 million, we anticipate that this application could be accessed by many people across the state over a period of time and so this application is designed accordingly to be able to scale up and down based on the demand. This application processes the Victoria state crash history data from the year 2006 to date (2020).
